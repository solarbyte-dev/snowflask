## Uploading Files

This app does **not** have a web-based uploader (by design, as it is meant to be a quick and dirty way to share files).

To upload:

* Simply **drag and drop** files into the `/Uploads` folder using your file explorer or terminal.
* Refresh the web page to see them appear.

---

## Notes

* This is intended for **local network use only** ‚Äî it is not secure for public internet use.
* Make sure port `6002` is open on your firewall if accessing from other devices.
* To change the port, edit `snowflask.py`.
